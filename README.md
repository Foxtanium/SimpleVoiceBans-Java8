# SimpleVoiceBans-Java8

This plugin is a fork of [SimpleVoiceBans](https://github.com/KoxSosen/SimpleVoiceBans) wich itself provides a [SimpleVoiceChat](https://github.com/henkelmax/simple-voice-chat) integration for [LibertyBans](https://github.com/A248/LibertyBans/), but unlike the original this fork provides support for Java 8.

You can use this resource in two ways:

In case you have LibertyBans installed on the backend server(s):
- Install SimpleVoiceChat on all backend servers, and the proxy implementation.
- Install SimpleVoiceBans on all backend servers.

In case you have LibertyBans installed on the proxy server:
- Install SimpleVoiceChat on all backend servers, and the proxy implementation.
- Install SimpleVoiceBans on all backend servers, and the proxy implementation.

Additional notes:

If you'd like to show players that they're muted, and they can't talk, add the `simplevoicebans.actionbar` permission node as `true`.

This is how it looks like:

Get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/KoxSosen/SimpleVoiceBans/releases), or get a development build from the CI. (to be added).

Additionally please do note that this isn't an official resource from the LibertyBans team, but rather a fun project of mine.
